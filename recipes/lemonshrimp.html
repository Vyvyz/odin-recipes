        <br/>
        <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crushed garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>5 large basil leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper; add to the pan and cook 30 seconds per side. Remove to a plate.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Add shallots to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, lemon zest, and 1/2 of the lemon juice; heat for 2 minutes. Reserve remaining lemon juice for another use.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Add cream and bring to a simmer. Return shrimp to the skillet and cook until heated through and pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Add basil.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Drain spaghetti, reserving 1/4 to 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Add spaghetti to the skillet. Add pasta water as needed and pepper flakes; toss to coat. Season with pepper if desired.</li>
